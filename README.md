## Using Fabric React

[Here is a step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Sample-App) on how to build a simple React app with office-ui-fabric-react components.

How to integrate components into your project depends heavily on your setup. The recommended setup is to use a bundler such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) which can resolve NPM package imports in your code and bundle only the specific things you import.

Within an npm project, you should install the package and save it as a dependency:

```
npm install --save office-ui-fabric-react
```

This will add the package as a dependency in your `package.json` file and download it under `node_modules/office-ui-fabric-react`.

The library includes ES2015 module entry points under the `lib` folder (use `lib-amd` if you need AMD, or `lib-commonjs` if you need commonjs). To use a control, import it and then use it in your render method:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { PrimaryButton } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Button';

ReactDOM.render(<PrimaryButton>I am a button.</PrimaryButton>, document.body.firstChild);
```

### Version policy

Fabric React adheres to [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org/). However, we only consider constructs directly importable at the package level or from files at the root (e.g. `office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Utilities` or `office-ui-fabric-react/lib-amd/Styling`) to be part of our API surface. Everything else is considered package-internal and may be subject to changes, moves, renames, etc.

### Browser support

Fabric React supports all evergreen browsers, with IE 11 as the min-bar version of Internet Explorer. See the [browser support doc](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Browser-Support) for more information.

### Right-to-left support

All components can render in LTR or RTL, depending on the `dir` attribute set on the `html` element (`dir="rtl"` will flip the direction of everything). You can also use the `setRTL` API if you don't have control over the `html` element's rendering. Example:

```tsx
import { setRTL } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Utilities';

setRTL(true);
```

### Server-side rendering

Fabric components can be rendered in a server-side Node environment (or used in tests which run in an SSR-like environment), but it requires customizing how styles and SCSS files are loaded. See the [server-side rendering documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Server-side-rendering-and-browserless-testing) for examples of how to handle this.

### Advanced usage

For info about advanced usage including module- vs. path-based imports, using an AMD bundler like RequireJS, and deployment features, see our [advanced documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Advanced-Usage).

## Contribute to Fabric React

Please take a look at our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Contributing) for more info. Also read [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Bug-Fixes) and [Contribute new component](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/New-Components).

## Building the repo

Before you get started, **make sure you have read the [Git branch setup instructions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Setup)**

To view the documentation including examples, contracts, component status, and to add functionality or fix issues locally, you can:

1. `git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react.git`
2. `cd office-ui-fabric-react`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

This will start a demo page from the office-ui-fabric-react package folder, which will open a web browser with the example page. You can make changes to the code which will automatically build and refresh the page using live-reload.

To build and run tests for all packages in the repo, run `npm run build` from the root.

To build individual packages within the `packages/*` or `apps/*` folders, `cd` to the relevant folder and run `npm run build`. Note that because the packages are symlinked together, you must manage building dependencies in the right order, or use the `rush` tool to build to the specific package you want. (See advanced tips below.)

### Testing

For info about testing, see our [testing documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/wiki/Testing).

### Advanced building tips

The repo contains many packages, each which may have dependencies on each other. You can use [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) to build projects in the correct order, if you have it globally installed.

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

To use Rush to build, you can run `rush build`, which will incrementally build the entire repo (only build what has changed since the last build). If you don't have Rush globally installed, you can use the command `npm run buildfast`, which abstracts `rush build`.

To build up to a specific project, use the `--to <package>` argument. For example, to build up to `office-ui-fabric-react`, run:

```bash
rush build --to office-ui-fabric-react
```
